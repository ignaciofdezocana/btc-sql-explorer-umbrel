version: "1.6.0"
tagline: Run SQL queries against your Bitcoin blockchain
description: >-
  BTC SQL Explorer lets you query your Bitcoin full node's blockchain data
  using SQL. It syncs blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs from your
  node into a local DuckDB database and provides a modern web UI with a
  CodeMirror SQL editor, results table, charting, and CSV export.


  Write any SQL query against your own blockchain data — analyze fee
  markets, track whale transactions, study mining patterns, examine script
  types, and more. Includes a library of example queries to get started.


  Your data never leaves your device. The app connects to your Umbrel's
  Bitcoin Core node via local RPC and stores the SQL database on your
  device's storage.
