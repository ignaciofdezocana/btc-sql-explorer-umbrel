tagline: Run SQL queries against your Bitcoin blockchain
description: >-
  BTC SQL Explorer lets you query your Bitcoin full node's blockchain data
  using SQL. It syncs blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs from your
  node into a local DuckDB database and provides a modern web UI with a
  CodeMirror SQL editor, results table, charting, and CSV export.


  Write any SQL query against your own blockchain data — analyze fee
  markets, track whale transactions, study mining patterns, examine script
  types, and more. Includes a library of example queries to get started.


  Your data never leaves your device. The app connects to your Umbrel's
  Bitcoin Core node via local RPC and stores the SQL database on your
  device's storage.

releaseNotes: >-
  Tuned sync performance for Umbrel Home hardware. Batch RPC calls
  reduce HTTP round trips from 100 to 2 per batch, but batch size
  stays at 50 blocks to keep DB writes short and avoid locking out
  the web UI. Removed parallel threads that overloaded Bitcoin Core
  on ARM. Mempool sync starts immediately without waiting for IBD.
