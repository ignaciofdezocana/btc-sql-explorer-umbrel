tagline: Run SQL queries against your Bitcoin blockchain
description: >-
  BTC SQL Explorer lets you query your Bitcoin full node's blockchain data
  using SQL. It syncs blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs from your
  node into a local DuckDB database and provides a modern web UI with a
  CodeMirror SQL editor, results table, charting, and CSV export.


  Write any SQL query against your own blockchain data — analyze fee
  markets, track whale transactions, study mining patterns, examine script
  types, and more. Includes a library of example queries to get started.


  Your data never leaves your device. The app connects to your Umbrel's
  Bitcoin Core node via local RPC and stores the SQL database on your
  device's storage.

releaseNotes: >-
  v1.7.1 – Sync speed optimization. Mempool sync is now postponed until
  blockchain is fully caught up, eliminating write-lock contention during
  the initial block sync. Mempool inserts upgraded to DataFrame-based
  bulk writes for 10-100x faster refreshes. Added per-batch timing
  diagnostics (RPC, parse, lock-wait, write durations) to both sync
  threads for easier performance monitoring.
