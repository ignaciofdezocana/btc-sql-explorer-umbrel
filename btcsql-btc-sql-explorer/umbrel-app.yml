tagline: Run SQL queries against your Bitcoin blockchain
description: >-
  BTC SQL Explorer lets you query your Bitcoin full node's blockchain data
  using SQL. It syncs blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs from your
  node into a local DuckDB database and provides a modern web UI with a
  CodeMirror SQL editor, results table, charting, and CSV export.


  Write any SQL query against your own blockchain data — analyze fee
  markets, track whale transactions, study mining patterns, examine script
  types, and more. Includes a library of example queries to get started.


  Your data never leaves your device. The app connects to your Umbrel's
  Bitcoin Core node via local RPC and stores the SQL database on your
  device's storage.

releaseNotes: >-
  v1.7.5 – Fix device freeze caused by v1.7.4. Reverted batch size
  from 200 to 50 (memory-safe for 4GB devices). Changed DuckDB
  auto-checkpoint threshold from 16GB to 256MB to cap WAL growth.
  Manual checkpoint now every 20 batches (1000 blocks) instead of 50.
  Retains checkpoint control for speed while staying safe on Umbrel Home.
